<h1 align="center">EyeTracking: A Dual-Camera System Designed to Assist in the Detection of Ocular Diseases in Infants</h1>

## Overview
<p><strong>EyeTracking</strong> is a GUI application developed with Qt Creator, designed to facilitate simultaneous recording from two cameras using threads This system is specifically tailored to assist the Laboratory of Prematurity â€“ LAPREM in their research and early detection efforts concerning ocular diseases in infants. It achieves this by capturing general movements activities, providing valuable data for analysis.</p>

<p>The system incorporates four distinct tests, each tailored to record a specific type of movement and ocular activity in newborns, making it a versatile tool in clinical diagnostics.</p>

## Technology Stack
